Scope: understand what parameters are important in the optimization

Workflow: 
Preparation steps:
0) Identify and filter events of interest in the MC

1) produce several .fcl files with 1 parameter changed at a time by:
> python parameterMap.py

2) run them on a subset of MC events (~600 evts). E.g.
> lar -c TrjClusterBaseLArIAT_PAR13.fcl ../misfits/filtered_output_*

3) evaluate if something in the recoL-trueL plot changed compared to the baseline.
